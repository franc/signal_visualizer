## SignalVisualizer

An elixir project to render a signal.

This is based on Elixir Sips #177: https://github.com/knewter/audio_visualizer

but for some reason I couldn't get the wxGraphicsContext to draw lines.

I then got working drawing code from @sasajuric at https://github.com/sasa1977/pythagoras_tree

So this is starting out as a mix of those two projects, but I hope to use it to to visualize a number of different signals.
